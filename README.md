# NLP Playground ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my NLP Playground! This repository documents my self-taught journey in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Here, I implement research papers, conduct curiosity-driven experiments, and deploy models following MLOps industry standards.  
The ressources for these experiments are limited. My main goal here is to learn.  
  
## Projects Overview

### 1. LLMs From Scratch âœ…
A comprehensive implementation of modern Language Models from the ground up, guided by Sebastian Raschka's "Building LLMs from Scratch". This project covers:

- Text preprocessing pipelines
- Attention mechanism implementation and visualization
- Complete transformer architecture
- GPT-2 model implementation
- Pretraining phase development
- Finetuning for:
  - Text classification
  - Instruction following

### 2. Financial NER with FiNER-ORD âœ…
Implementation and experimentation with the Financial NER Open Research Dataset (FiNER-ORD), exploring various approaches to Named Entity Recognition in the financial domain.  
Main notebook can be seen [here](https://github.com/MkYacine/NLP-playground/blob/main/FiNER/FiNER_comparison.ipynb)

- BERT finetuning on FiNER-ORD
- Model deployment on AWS SageMaker using structured jobs (for reproducability and practice purposes)
- Closed-source LLM
- Base GLiNER model
- Document findings and compare performance
- Finetuned GLiNER model ðŸš§

### 3. RAG ðŸš§
Implementation and experimentation with retrieval augmented generation, using the huggingface documentation as a knowledge base, trying different approaches in the RAG pipeline.

- Embedding and Retrieval: Test different strategies for chunking, embedding, retrieval, and reranking
- Generator: Test different generator models, prompts, and verification strategies.
