# NLP Playground ðŸ§ 

Welcome to my NLP Playground! This repository documents my self-taught journey in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Here, I implement research papers, conduct curiosity-driven experiments, and deploy models following MLOps industry standards.

## Projects Overview

### 1. LLMs From Scratch âœ…
A comprehensive implementation of modern Language Models from the ground up, guided by Sebastian Raschka's "Building LLMs from Scratch". This project covers:

- Text preprocessing pipelines
- Attention mechanism implementation and visualization
- Complete transformer architecture
- GPT-2 model implementation
- Pretraining phase development
- Finetuning for:
  - Text classification
  - Instruction following

**Implemented Papers:**
- Attention Is All You Need [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762]
- InstructGPT: Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback [https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155]

### 2. Financial NER with FiNER-ORD ðŸš§
Implementation and experimentation with the Financial NER Open Research Dataset (FiNER-ORD), exploring various approaches to Named Entity Recognition in the financial domain.

**Current Progress:**
- âœ… BERT finetuning on FiNER-ORD
- âœ… MLOps deployment on AWS SageMaker
- âœ… LLM finetuning
- ðŸ“‹ Closed-source LLM evaluation (Planned)
- ðŸ“‹ Document findings and compare performance and cost

**Implemented Papers:**
- FiNER-ORD: Building a High-Quality English Financial NER Open Research Dataset [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11157]

### Future Projects ðŸ“‹

**Planned Paper Implementations:**
- Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Without Prompting [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10200]
- Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073]
- Contextual Retrieval [https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval]
- And many more!
