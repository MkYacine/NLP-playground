In this video, we will look at what actually happens when we use the pipeline function of the Transformers library. More specifically, we will look at the sentiment analysis pipeline, and how it went from the two following sentences to the positive labels with their respective scores. As we have seen in the pipeline presentation, there are three stages in the pipeline. First, we convert the raw texts to numbers the model can make sense of, using a tokenizer. Then, those numbers go through the model, which outputs logits. Finally, the post-processing steps transforms those logits into labels and scores. Let's look in detail at those three steps, and how to replicate them using the Transformers library, beginning with the first stage, tokenization. The tokenization process has several steps. First, the text is split into small chunks called tokens. They can be words, parts of words or punctuation symbols. Then the tokenizer will had some special tokens (if the model expect them). Here the model uses expects a CLS token at the beginning and a SEP token at the end of the sentence to classify. Lastly, the tokenizer matches each token to its unique ID in the vocabulary of the pretrained model. To load such a tokenizer, the Transformers library provides the AutoTokenizer API. The most important method of this class is from_pretrained, which will download and cache the configuration and the vocabulary associated to a given checkpoint. Here, the checkpoint used by default for the sentiment analysis pipeline is distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english. We instantiate a tokenizer associated with that checkpoint, then feed it the two sentences. Since those two sentences are not of the same size, we will need to pad the shortest one to be able to build an array. This is done by the tokenizer with the option padding=True. With truncation=True, we ensure that any sentence longer than the maximum the model can handle is truncated. Lastly, the return_tensors option tells the tokenizer to return a PyTorch tensor. Looking at the result, we see we have a dictionary with two keys. Input IDs contains the IDs of both sentences, with 0s where the padding is applied. The second key, attention mask, indicates where padding has been applied, so the model does not pay attention to it. This is all what is inside the tokenization step. Now let's have a look at the second step, the model. As for the tokenizer, there is an AutoModel API, with a from_pretrained method. It will download and cache the configuration of the model as well as the pretrained weights. However, the AutoModel API will only instantiate the body of the model, that is, the part of the model that is left once the pretraining head is removed. It will output a high-dimensional tensor that is a representation of the sentences passed, but which is not directly useful for our classification problem. Here the tensor has two sentences, each of sixteen tokens and the last dimension is the hidden size of our model 768. To get an output linked to our classification problem, we need to use the AutoModelForSequenceClassification class. It works exactly as the AutoModel class, except that it will build a model with a classification head. There is one auto class for each common NLP task in the Transformers library. Here, after giving our model the two sentences, we get a tensor of size two by two: one result for each sentence and for each possible label. Those outputs are not probabilities yet (we can see they don't sum to 1). This is because each model of the Transformers library returns logits. To make sense of those logits, we need to dig into the third and last step of the pipeline: post-processing. To convert logits into probabilities, we need to apply a SoftMax layer to them. As we can see, this transforms them into positive numbers that sum up to 1. The last step is to know which of those corresponds to the positive or the negative label. This is given by the id2label field of the model config. The first probabilities (index 0) correspond to the negative label, and the seconds (index 1) correspond to the positive label. This is how our classifier built with the pipeline function picked those labels and computed those scores. Now that you know how each steps works, you can easily tweak them to your needs.\",\n          \"!--Copyright 2022 The HuggingFace Team.

The usual workflow\\nfrom PyTorch is:\\n\\n1. Create your model with random weights.\\n2. Load your pretrained weights.\\n3. Put those pretrained weights in your random model.\\n\\nStep 1 and 2 both require a full version of the model in memory, which is not a problem in most cases, but if your model starts weighing several GigaBytes, those two copies can make you get out of RAM. Even worse, if you are using `torch.distributed` to launch a distributed training, each process will load the pretrained model and store these two copies in RAM.\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\nNote that the randomly created model is initialized with \\\"empty\\\" tensors, which take the space in memory without filling it (thus the random values are whatever was in this chunk of memory at a given time). The random initialization following the appropriate distribution for the kind of model/parameters instantiated (like a normal distribution for instance) is only performed after step 3 on the non-initialized weights, to be as fast as possible! \\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\nIn this guide, we explore the solutions Transformers offer to deal with this issue. Note that this is an area of active development, so the APIs explained here may change slightly in the future.\\n\\n## Sharded checkpoints\\n\\nSince version 4.18.0, model checkpoints that end up taking more than 10GB of space are automatically sharded in smaller pieces. In terms of having one single checkpoint when you do `model.save_pretrained(save_dir)`, you will end up with several partial checkpoints (each of which being of size < 10GB) and an index that maps parameter names to the files they are stored in.\\n\\nYou can control the maximum size before sharding with the `max_shard_size` parameter, so for the sake of an example, we'll use a normal-size models with a small shard size: let's take a traditional BERT model.\\n\\n```py\\nfrom transformers import AutoModel\\n\\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\\\"bert-base-cased\\\")\\n```\\n\\nIf you save it using [`~PreTrainedModel.save_pretrained`], you will get a new folder with two files: the config of the model and its weights:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> import os\\n>>> import tempfile\\n\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir)\\n...     print(sorted(os.listdir(tmp_dir)))\\n['config.json', 'pytorch_model.bin']\\n```\\n\\nNow let's use a maximum shard size of 200MB:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\\\"200MB\\\")\\n...     print(sorted(os.listdir(tmp_dir)))\\n['config.json', 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin', 'pytorch_model-00002-of-00003.bin', 'pytorch_model-00003-of-00003.bin', 'pytorch_model.bin.index.json']\\n```\\n\\nOn top of the configuration of the model, we see three different weights files, and an `index.json` file which is our index. A checkpoint like this can be fully reloaded using the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\\\"200MB\\\")\\n...     new_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(tmp_dir)\\n```\\n\\nThe main advantage of doing this for big models is that during step 2 of the workflow shown above, each shard of the checkpoint is loaded after the previous one, capping the memory usage in RAM to the model size plus the size of the biggest shard.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, the index file is used to determine which keys are in the checkpoint, and where the corresponding weights are stored. We can load that index like any json and get a dictionary:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> import json\\n\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\\\"200MB\\\")\\n...     with open(os.path.join(tmp_dir, \\\"pytorch_model.bin.index.json\\\"), \\\"r\\\") as f:\\n...         index = json.load(f)\\n\\n>>> print(index.keys())\\ndict_keys(['metadata', 'weight_map'])\\n```\\n\\nThe metadata just consists of the total size of the model for now. We plan to add other information in the future:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> index[\\\"metadata\\\"]\\n{'total_size': 433245184}\\n```\\n\\nThe weights map is the main part of this index, which maps each parameter name (as usually found in a PyTorch model `state_dict`) to the file it's stored in:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> index[\\\"weight_map\\\"]\\n{'embeddings.LayerNorm.bias': 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin',\\n 'embeddings.LayerNorm.weight': 'pytorch_model-00001-of-00003.bin',\\n ...\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to directly load such a sharded checkpoint inside a model without using [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] (like you would do `model.load_state_dict()` for a full checkpoint) you should use [`~modeling_utils.load_sharded_checkpoint`]:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> from transformers.modeling_utils import load_sharded_checkpoint\\n\\n>>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:\\n...     model.save_pretrained(tmp_dir, max_shard_size=\\\"200MB\\\")\\n...     load_sharded_checkpoint(model, tmp_dir)\\n```\\n\\n## Low memory loading\\n\\nSharded checkpoints reduce the memory usage during step 2 of the workflow mentioned above, but in order to use that model in a low memory setting, we recommend leveraging our tools based on the Accelerate library.\\n\\nPlease read the following guide for more information: [Large model loading using Accelerate](./main_classes/model#large-model-loading)\\n\",\n          \" `tokenizers-linux-x64-musl`\\n\\nThis is the **x86_64-unknown-linux-musl** binary for `tokenizers`\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"What is the default checkpoint used by the sentiment analysis pipeline in the Transformers library?\\n\",\n          \"What is the maximum size of a model checkpoint before it is automatically sharded in Transformers version 4.18.0?\\n\",\n          \"What architecture is the `tokenizers-linux-x64-musl` binary designed for?\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"distilbert base uncased finetuned sst2 english\",\n          \"10GB\",\n          \"x86_64-unknown-linux-musl\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source_doc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"huggingface/course/blob/main/subtitles/en/raw/chapter2/02_inside-pipeline-pt.md\",\n          \"huggingface/transformers/blob/main/docs/source/en/big_models.md\",\n          \"huggingface/tokenizers/blob/main/bindings/node/npm/linux-x64-musl/README.md\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standalone_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 5,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"standalone_eval\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 65,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The question is asking for a specific piece of information about the default settings within a well-known library in the machine learning community, the Transformers library by Hugging Face.
